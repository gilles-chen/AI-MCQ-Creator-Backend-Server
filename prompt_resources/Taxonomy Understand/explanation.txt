The Understand level of Bloom's Taxonomy focuses on comprehension and interpretation tasks. 
This level assesses a student's ability to grasp the meaning of material that has been learned. 
Students are expected to explain ideas or concepts, interpret facts, compare, contrast, and predict consequences. 
This level goes beyond mere recall of facts, requiring students to make sense of and articulate the information they have learned.

## Key Features of MCQs at the "Understand" Level
1. **Interpretation**: Questions require students to paraphrase, explain, or interpret information in their own words.
2. **Exemplification**: Students must provide examples or explain how concepts are applied in real scenarios.
3. **Summarization**: Questions may ask students to summarize a concept or narrative succinctly.
