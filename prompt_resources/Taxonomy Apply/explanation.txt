The Apply level of Bloom's Taxonomy is centered around the application of knowledge and skills in new and concrete situations. 
This level tests a student's ability to use learned material through the execution of procedures or tasks. 
Students are required to implement, demonstrate, or carry out learned concepts in various contexts, such as solving problems or conducting experiments.
