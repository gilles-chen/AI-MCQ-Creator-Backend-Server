## Guidelines for the Stem
- The stem should be meaningful by itself and provide a complete idea.
- Avoid ambiguous statements and including irrelevant information in the stem.
- The stem should be in the form of a question or an incomplete sentence that the options will complete.

## Guidelines for the Distractors
- Distractors must be plausible and relevant to the question.
- Distractors must not overlap with the correct answer.
- Distractors should be homogeneous in content to avoid giving away clues about the correct answer.

## General Guidelines
- Ensure the correct answer cannot be easily guessed.
- Use consistent formatting across all options (e.g., same tense, structure).
